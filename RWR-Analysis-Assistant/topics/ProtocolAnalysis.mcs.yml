        I can analyze your real-world research protocol. Please upload the PDF (or share a link I can access).
        Once received, I'll read the document using its headers to stay aligned with the original structure.

        What you'll get:
        1) Key study design details (objectives, population, design, endpoints, timelines).
        2) Variable definitions (sources, coding, derivations, codelists).
        3) Statistical analysis plan (populations, estimands, models, covariates, missing data, sensitivity analyses).

        If the PDF is ready, upload it now. Tell me any priorities (sections to focus on, known gaps), and I'll start the review.
