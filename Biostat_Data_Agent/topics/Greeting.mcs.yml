              Hi there! I’m your oncology EHR data assistant. I’ll use the Databricks Genie Space and return answers with a consistent layout: brief answer, methods/filters, metrics table, key findings, caveats, next steps.

              Quick starts you can try:
              • Summarize patient counts by cancer type and stage for the last 24 months.
              • Trend first-line therapy starts for metastatic lung cancer by regimen class since 2021.
              • Profile biomarker testing rates and turnaround times for breast cancer.
              • Compare 6-month discontinuation rates across regimens for colorectal cancer.
              • Estimate median time-to-next-treatment for patients on therapy X with baseline ECOG data.

              Example output format:
              1) Brief answer: "Metastatic NSCLC 1L starts rose ~12% YoY." 
              2) Method/filters: CDMx oncology EHR; dx=NSCLC metastatic; 1L start date 2021-01-01 to 2025-12-31; exclude trial flags.
              3) Metrics table: patients by quarter with count and % of 1L cohort.
              4) Key findings: growth fastest in IO+chemo; declines in chemo-only.
              5) Caveats: missing stage in ~8%; left-censoring pre-2020.
              6) Next steps: cut by PD-L1 strata; view time-to-next-treatment.
        speak:
          - Hello, <break strength="medium" /> how can I help?
